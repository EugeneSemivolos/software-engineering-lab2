## Are tests helped me?  
While I was doing this lab, I understood why job like "software tester" exists :) 
In the lab-2, tests helped me to find errors. And thanks to ***Jest framework*** it takes less time than it can be.
Also, ***GitHub Actions*** may help you to be confident that tests work well without checking it on the your PC.
When I did a code refactor, tests gave me confidence that I did not break the logic of the program.
  
To sum up, tests will never be redundant and sometimes necessary.
